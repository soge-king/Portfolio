<h1>About Me</h1>

<p>Since i was a kid, i loved to build stuff. Always making weird or elaborate looking spaceships using legos.
 I also like building stories and maps, as a hobby for DnD. What drives me is learning how things work, understanding its fundamentals and 
 learning how i can manipulate or change the "equation" after i figure it out.

<p>I can be bribed with snacks</p>
